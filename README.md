# Django Web App: Multi-User Social Platform

## üåü Overview

This project is a feature-rich **Django Web Application** designed to provide a seamless user experience for **registration**, **authentication**, and a **social feed** with interactive functionalities. It allows users to register, log in, log out, and manage their profiles while offering the ability to create posts with images and captions, like and comment on posts, and view an engaging feed of posts by all users.

The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive design and leverages **AJAX** for dynamic interactions like liking posts without page reloads. It also uses Django ORM for efficient database management.
